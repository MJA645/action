# Dev Container Action

This action is used to package and generate documentation for [dev container features](https://containers.dev/implementors/features/).  Running this action will publish all dev container features in accordance with the [_proposed_ dev container feature distribution specification](https://containers.dev/implementors/features-distribution/).

This action is used in the [`devcontainer/features`](https://github.com/devcontainers/features) repo, in the [release.yaml](https://github.com/devcontainers/features/blob/main/.github/workflows/release.yaml) workflow.

<!-- To get started, create your own repo from the [`devcontainers/feature-template`](https://github.com/devcontainers/feature-template) template. -->
